# Medical Help - No excuses for delays in taking medicines

This is an application targeting the _aged population_ as a medical helper. The user or anyone on behalf of the user can enter the medicine reminders such as name, quantity and when it should be taken as a reminder. The reminder helps the user to look into the details of tablets that he or she has to take. The user can also save the medical reports through the Health Records button.
